                Oromo, also known as Afaan Oromoo, and Oromiffa, is a language from the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and the third most widely spoken language in Africa, 
                after Arabic and Hausa. The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. They are an indigenous African people who have maintained their cultural identity and language despite the
                 Oromo language being forbidden for much of the 20th century. Most Oromos live in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia and Somalia), Kenia, Eritrea, and Djibouti, 
                as well as in the Oromo Diaspora abroad.

            <p class="paragraph"> The Oromos are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia 
                (45% of the population), 
                numbering about 55 million. They are predominantly
                 concentrated in the Oromia Region in central Ethiopia, the largest
                  region in the country by both population and area. 
                 They speak Afaan Oromoo, the official language of Oromia.

                The Oromo People Created One Of The Earliest Democracies
                The traditional Oromo society is structured according to the Gadaa system, also spelled as Gada. 
                The system is considered to be one of the earliest democratic societies in the world and is based on an 8-yearly election of all political, military, 
                economic, religious, and social administration.
                The society has five classes with one fulfilling the function of the ruling class; this changes every 8 years. Each class progresses through a number 
                of grades before it can participate in authority.
                A Gadaa election is preceded by a campaign. One of the basic rules of the Gadaa is that a father and his son are always exactly five grades apart, which is always forty years. 
                This means that the Gadaa class incorporates people of various ages.
